# 🏗️ OCaml Problem Collection  

A diverse collection of OCaml problems and utilities, featuring everything from **binary trees** to **Peano arithmetic**, **lazy lists**, and **module manipulations**. This repo is a playground of recursion, functional programming tricks, and questionable final commits.  

## 📌 Highlights  

- 🌳 **Binary Trees** – Recursive structures, because loops are too mainstream.  
- 📂 **File Handling** – Reading, writing, and pretending OCaml is good for I/O.  
- 🏎️ **Merge Sort & Tail Recursion** – Functional efficiency (or lack thereof).  
- 📚 **Modules & Functors** – Because why keep things simple?  
- 📜 **Peano Arithmetic** – Counting the hard way.  
- 🔄 **Partial Application & Folding** – Proof that function composition is a lifestyle.  
- 🧩 **Quadtrees & Vectors** – Geometry, the functional way.  
- 🌐 **Blog Server & Threads** – Experimental concurrency and web-ish things.
